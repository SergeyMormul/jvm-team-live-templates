# JVM Team IntelliJ Live Templates
Useful custom IntelliJ IDEA live templates.

## Reason
Working on several projects on Groovy I noticed a lot of routine actions which would be good to have short cuts or live templates for. Live templates are more suitable for code generation.

## Benefits
* Helps write code faster.
* Helps keep code formatted properly.
* Helps follow requirements, e.g. Groovy docs, specific description, etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the project to a local directory
<br/>```git clone https://github.com/SergeyMormul/jvm-team-live-templates```
1. Start IntelliJ IDEA
1. Import the settings from `JvmTeamLiveTemplates.zip` into IntelliJ following the instructions [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-live-templates.html).

## Content
The settings contains following groups of live templates:
* [Groovy Routine](descriptions/groovyRoutine/README.md)
* [Mongo Documents](descriptions/mongoDocuments/README.md)
* [Spock Testing](descriptions/spockTesting/README.md)

## Enjoy your codding!
